# Password Generator

##description
used javascript to make a function that would choose from the array of numeric, lowercase, upper case, special characters by a series of question prompts that would create a randomized password. If the person chooses none of the choices, it would prompt that they would have to choose at least one of the criteria to create from. they would also need to choose 8 to 128 or it would not meet length criteria between the 8 and 128
